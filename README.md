# Fixed-Income-Valuation
This app uses Python and Streamlit to value fixed income securities. It calculates bond price, durations, convexity, and provides recommendations. It simulates short-rate paths with the Hull-White model, plots results with Plotly, and includes an option to save and download simulated rates as a CSV.
